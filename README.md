# Suager_v5
Suager v5
by Regaus

My server: https://discord.gg/cw7czUx

# Requirements
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

# Setup
1. [Create a bot here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Copy config_example.json and name it config.json
NOTE: some functions depend on the existence of both config_example and config, so don't remove it!
3. Copy your bot's token to config.json
4. For the weather command, get a key [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
5. Configure user prefixes and owner-only prefixes, playing status, etc. 
6. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Start the bot using `python index.py`

If this works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

Hopefully this shit will work.

To add your bot to your server use this URL: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot
